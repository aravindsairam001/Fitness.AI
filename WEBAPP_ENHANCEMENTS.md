# 🚀 Fitness.AI - Professional Webapp Enhancements

## ✅ Implemented Features (Inspired by Top Fitness Apps)

### 1. 💪 **Weight Tracking System**
**Inspiration**: Strong, Hevy, JEFIT

**What it does**:
- Track the weight you use for each exercise
- See your last weight used as reference
- Easy +/- buttons to adjust weight (2.5kg increments)
- Automatically saves weight history per exercise
- Visual indicator showing "Last: Xkg"

**Why it matters**: This is THE #1 feature request in fitness apps. Knowing what weight you lifted last time helps you progressively overload and actually see strength gains.

**How to use**:
1. During workout, use the weight input below the set counter
2. Press + or - buttons to adjust (or type directly)
3. Complete your set - weight is automatically saved
4. Next time you do that exercise, you'll see your previous weight

### 2. ⏱️ **Exercise Duration Timer**
**Inspiration**: Strong, Fitbod

**What it does**:
- Tracks how long you spend on each exercise
- Displays live timer in the top-right corner
- Automatically resets when moving to next exercise
- Shows minutes:seconds format (e.g., 3:45)

**Why it matters**: Time under tension and workout pacing are crucial. This helps you identify if you're rushing or taking too long between sets.

**Location**: Top-right corner of workout screen, next to the info button

### 3. 🎯 **Rest Timer Presets**
**Inspiration**: Fitbod, Strong

**What it does**:
- Quick preset buttons: 30s, 60s, 90s, 120s
- Instantly set your rest time with one tap
- Visual highlight shows which preset is active
- Perfect for different exercise types:
  - 30s: Core work, isolation exercises
  - 60s: Standard rest (default)
  - 90s: Compound lifts (squats, deadlifts)
  - 120s: Heavy strength work

**Why it matters**: Different exercises need different rest times. Compound lifts need 90-120s, while isolation work needs 30-60s. Quick presets make this effortless.

**Location**: During rest timer, above the "Up Next" preview

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Professional Design Elements:
- **Weight Input**: Styled with purple gradient border, large text, responsive buttons
- **Exercise Timer**: Cyan color (stands out but not distracting), compact design
- **Rest Presets**: Visual feedback when selected (purple highlight)
- **Smooth Transitions**: All new elements use consistent animations
- **Mobile-First**: Touch-friendly button sizes, proper spacing

### Smart Defaults:
- Weight starts at last used weight (or 0 for first time)
- Rest timer defaults to 60s (industry standard)
- Exercise timer automatically starts on first set
- All data persists in localStorage

## 📊 Technical Implementation

### Data Persistence:
```javascript
// Weight history stored per exercise
localStorage: {
  exerciseWeights: {
    "Goblet Squats": 20,
    "Dumbbell Bench Press": 25,
    "Overhead Press": 17.5,
    // ... etc
  }
}
```

### Performance:
- Lightweight timers using setInterval
- Efficient localStorage reads/writes
- No external dependencies
- Fast DOM updates

- Workout templates/customization
- Export data to CSV
- Social features (share PRs)
- Apple Health / Google Fit integration
