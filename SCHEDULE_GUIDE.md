## HIIT Cardio Finisher (15 minutes)

Use the built-in HIIT timer on the HIIT tab!

### Protocol:
- **Warm-up**: 2 minutes easy pace
- **Interval 1**: 30 seconds ALL OUT SPRINT
- **Interval 2**: 60 seconds slow walking/pedaling
- **Repeat**: 8-10 cycles
- **Cool-down**: 2 minutes easy pace

This is far more effective for fat loss than 30 minutes of steady cardio!
